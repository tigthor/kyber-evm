## How to get the evm binaries

### Requirements

Wallets

- A [Keplr](https://keplr.app) wallet with $KYVE. (You can claim some [here](https://app.kyve.network/faucet))
- An [Arweave](https://arweave.org/) keyfile with some AR. (You can claim some [here](https://faucet.arweave.net/))

Minimum hardware requirements

- 1vCPU
- 4GB RAM
- 1GB DISK

### Get the prebuilt binaries

The prebuilt binaries for every operating system can be downloaded at the [EVM repository](https://github.com/KYVENetwork/evm) under `releases`.

### Manually build the binaries

Since we want to run a protocol node on a `@kyve/evm` runtime pool we have to clone the correct repository. In our
case clone the [EVM repository](https://github.com/KYVENetwork/evm) and make sure your are on branch `main`.

```
git clone https://github.com/KYVENetwork/evm.git
cd evm
```

Now run the following commands to install dependencies and build the binaries

```
yarn install
yarn build:binaries
```

> Note: In the future we will add Docker support and release the prebuilt binaries to GitHub

### Verify that your binary has been built correctly

The step above should have created a directory called `out` with three binaries. Now execute the correct binary that matches your operating system using the following command (example is on a MacOS machine)

```
./out/evm-macos --help
```

If everything is set up correctly you should see the following

```
Usage: @kyve/evm [options]
